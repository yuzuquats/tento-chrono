/**
 * Google Calendar-specific recurrence rule implementation
 *
 * This implementation handles Google Calendar's specific behavior for recurrence
 * rules, which differs from the standard RFC 5545 iCalendar specification in
 * several key ways:
 *
 * ## DST (Daylight Saving Time) Handling
 *
 * Google Calendar preserves local time across DST transitions rather than UTC time.
 * This means:
 * - When DST begins (spring forward): Events maintain their local time, effectively
 *   shifting earlier in UTC
 * - When DST ends (fall back): Events maintain their local time, effectively
 *   shifting later in UTC
 *
 * Example:
 * - Event at 10:00 AM EST before DST → 10:00 AM EDT after DST
 * - UTC time changes from 15:00 to 14:00, but local time stays 10:00
 *
 * ## UNTIL Date Handling
 *
 * Google Calendar treats UNTIL dates differently based on whether they include
 * a time component:
 * - **Date-only UNTIL** (e.g., `20250610`): Exclusive of the entire day
 * - **DateTime UNTIL** (e.g., `20150209T043000Z`): Inclusive up to exact datetime
 *
 * This differs from RFC 5545 which specifies UNTIL as always inclusive.
 *
 * ## BYDAY Parsing
 *
 * Google Calendar supports nth-weekday patterns in BYDAY rules:
 * - `2TU` = second Tuesday of the month
 * - `-1FR` = last Friday of the month
 * - `TU` = every Tuesday (regular weekday pattern)
 *
 * The implementation detects the pattern type and uses appropriate filtering.
 *
 * ## Implementation Details
 *
 * - Uses `GoogleEventGenerator` class for Google-specific event generation
 * - Leverages `TimezoneRegion.googleDatetimeResolved()` for DST handling
 * - Implements proper date-only vs datetime UNTIL distinction in RRule parsing
 * - Handles nth-weekday patterns via `bynthday` field in RRuleLike interface
 *
 * ## Key Learnings
 *
 * During implementation, we discovered that Google Calendar's behavior differs
 * significantly from RFC 5545 in subtle but important ways:
 *
 * 1. **UNTIL Date Interpretation**: The presence or absence of a time component
 *    in the UNTIL value completely changes the semantic meaning (inclusive vs exclusive)
 *
 * 2. **DST Transition Handling**: Google Calendar prioritizes user experience
 *    (consistent local time) over strict UTC time preservation
 *
 * 3. **Test-Driven Discovery**: Many of these behaviors were discovered through
 *    systematic testing against real Google Calendar API responses rather than
 *    being documented in official specifications
 *
 * These differences highlight the importance of testing against actual API
 * behavior rather than relying solely on standards documentation.

/**
 * Google Calendar-specific event generator that handles recurrence rules
 * with Google Calendar's specific behavior for DST and UNTIL dates.
 *
 * Key differences from standard RFC 5545 behavior:
 *
 * 1. **DST Handling**: Preserves local time across DST transitions using
 *    `TimezoneRegion.googleDatetimeResolved()` method
 *
 * 2. **UNTIL Date Processing**: Handles date-only UNTIL values as exclusive
 *    of the entire day (vs. RFC 5545's inclusive behavior)
 *
 * 3. **Timezone Context**: Maintains original timezone context for proper
 *    DST transition handling throughout the recurrence sequence
 *
 * Usage (via `Recurrence.generateGoogleEvents`):
 * ```ts
 * import { assertEquals } from "@std/assert";
 * import { naivedate, Recurrence, TimezoneRegion, Utc } from "@tento/chrono";
 *
 * const recurrence = (await Recurrence.parse(["RRULE:FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=MO,WE;COUNT=4"])).exp();
 * const tz = TimezoneRegion.UTC;
 * const start = tz.toTz(Utc.parse("2026-01-05T09:00:00Z")!);
 * const generator = await recurrence.generateGoogleEvents(start, tz);
 * const events = generator.generateUpToDate(naivedate(2026, 1, 31));
 * assertEquals(events.map(String), [
 *   "2026-01-05T09:00:00Z",
 *   "2026-01-07T09:00:00Z",
 *   "2026-01-12T09:00:00Z",
 *   "2026-01-14T09:00:00Z",
